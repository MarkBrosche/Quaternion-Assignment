# Quaternion-Assignment
The goal was to develop an app in OpenGL and the Cyclone Physics engine that demonstrates my understanding of Quaternion rotations.

Run GamePhysicsApp.exe in the debug folder to see the application.
Keyboard inputs are described in the report.

You can inspect my code in the QuatApp.cpp file.
